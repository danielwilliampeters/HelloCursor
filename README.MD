# HelloCursor

A World of Warcraft addon that adds a smooth, highly visible ring around your mouse cursor, making it much easier to track during combat, fast camera movement, and busy encounters.

Designed for Retail with performance, polish, and configurability in mind.

## Features

- **Highly visible cursor ring**: Adds a hollow ring around your cursor so it never gets lost in combat
- **Colour customisation**: Choose any colour using the built-in colour picker or manual hex input
- **Reactive cursor mode**: Smoothly shrinks the ring when holding right mouse (mouselook)
- **Freeze on mouselook**: Ring stays at the last cursor position when camera movement begins
- **Zone-aware visibility**: Configure visibility separately for world, PvE, and PvP
- **Combat override**: Option to force the ring to show anywhere while in combat
- **Polished animation**: Subtle 0.08s size tween for smooth transitions
- **Defaults reset**: Restore all settings with a single click
- **Lightweight**: Extremely low performance impact (single frame, single texture)
- **Slash commands**: Quick access to settings via `/hc` or `/hellocursor`
