# Hello Cursor

A World of Warcraft addon that adds a smooth, highly visible ring around your mouse cursor, making it much easier to track during combat, fast camera movement, and busy encounters.

Designed for Retail with performance, polish, and configurability in mind.

## Features

- **Highly visible cursor ring**: Adds a hollow ring around your cursor so it never gets lost in combat
- **Colour customisation**: Choose any colour using the built-in colour picker or manual hex input
- **Class colour option**: Automatically tint the ring using your character’s class colour
- **Reactive cursor mode**: Smoothly shrinks the ring when holding right mouse (mouselook), optional and off by default
- **Freeze on mouselook**: Ring stays at the last cursor position when camera movement begins
- **Zone-aware visibility**: Configure visibility separately for world, player housing, PvE, and PvP
- **Show in combat**: Display the ring whenever you are in combat (enabled by default)
- **Global cooldown indicator**: Optional GCD visual on the cursor ring (off by default)
- **Classic vs neon style**: Choose between a flat classic ring or a neon-style ring with inner glow
- **Polished animation**: Subtle 0.08s size tween for smooth transitions
- **Defaults reset**: Restore all settings with a single click
- **Lightweight**: Extremely low performance impact (single frame, asset-based rendering)
- **Slash commands**: Quick access to settings via `/hc` or `/hellocursor`

## Configuration

- Open the settings panel via `/hc`, `/hellocursor`, or the Interface → Options → AddOns → Hello Cursor entry.
- Adjust visibility per zone type (world, player housing, PvE, PvP) and choose whether the ring always shows in combat.
- Toggle reactive cursor mode, the global cooldown animation, and whether the ring hides while game menus are open.
- Pick a custom ring colour (or use class colour), select ring size, and switch between classic and neon ring styles.

## Installation

1. Download the addon
2. Extract the `HelloCursor` folder to your `World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns\` directory
